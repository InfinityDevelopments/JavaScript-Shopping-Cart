This JavaScript Shopping Cart project contains the logic to run all the operations needed for selling stuff online. It contains functions like: adding items to the cart, removing items one by one, removing all items, clearing whole cart, return total of items in the cart, total cost of the items in the cart, display the cart, save the cart to local storage (if you leave page and come back to it, and also use the same cart on a different page), load previously saved cart and list everything in the cart. 

It is work in the progress and any comments, ideas or help are all welcome. 
Happy coding folks. 
Peace
